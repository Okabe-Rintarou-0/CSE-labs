## Hands-on-3: Domain Name Service (DNS)

> **Q1: What's the role of DNS? Please describe it using your own words.**

DNS is responsible for mapping a domain name to its corresponding ip address. It's not user friendly for the users to always visit a website through ip address, for it's difficult to remember. With DNS, users can type a string of url (like www.baidu.com) instead of ip address. Therefore, the role of DNS is to make it easier to visit a website or use a web service.

> **Q2: How can you ask a specific DNS server (instead of the default) for information about a domain name? For example, once the default server crashes and you wish to ask the other server 8.8.8.8, what command should you use?**
